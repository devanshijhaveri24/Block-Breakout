# Block-Breakout
Block Breakout is a game which is coded in Python using the Turtle library. It is a 1 player game where the user has to move the slider to allow the ball to hit the blocks and break. The player will have 3 lives to try and break all the bricks in the frame. At the end of the game the final score is displayed.
The user has to move the right and left arrow key to move the slider. As long as the ball hits the slider the game continues. If, the ball misses the slider more than 3 times the game comes to an end.
